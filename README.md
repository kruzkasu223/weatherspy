# WeatherSpy

### Setup

I have used OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data, you will need to add API
key.

Visit [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the API key, and
visit `.env.example` file to see how to use it.

Once you are done adding env install all the dependencies, you can run: `yarn`
or `npm i` or `pnpm i` (depending on the package manager you use)

Then to start the project, you can run: `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` or
`pnpm dev`

Successfully doing that will run the app in the development mode. Open
[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.
